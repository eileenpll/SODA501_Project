# GOP State Party Website Scraper

This script, written in Python 2.7, downloads webpages that hold press/news releases from 28 state parties with BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Releases from some states were collected manually, since there were so few releases (i.e. Indiana GOP has posted 3 press releases). We have eight more states to scrape so stay tuned for updates.
